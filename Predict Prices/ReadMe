Predict prices using regression with ML.NET.

This tutorial illustrates how to build a regression model using ML.NET to predict prices, specifically, New York City taxi fares.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

Prepare and understand the data
Load and transform the data
Choose a learning algorithm
Train the model
Evaluate the model
Use the model for predictions

Regression:

A supervised machine learning task that is used to predict the value of the label from a set of related features. 
The label can be of any real value and is not from a finite set of values as in classification tasks. 
Regression algorithms model the dependency of the label on its related features to determine how the label will change as the values of the features are varied. 
The input of a regression algorithm is a set of examples with labels of known values. 
The output of a regression algorithm is a function, which you can use to predict the label value for any new set of input features. Examples of regression scenarios include:

Predicting house prices based on house attributes such as number of bedrooms, location, or size.
Predicting future stock prices based on historical data and current market trends.
Predicting sales of a product based on advertising budgets.
