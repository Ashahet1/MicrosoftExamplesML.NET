This are the examples tried for learning machine learning from Microsoft ML.NET.

Example 1: Basic Classification (Binary Classification):

- Deals with classifying data points into **exactly two** predefined categories.
- Often referred to as binary classification because there are only two possible outcomes.
- Examples:
    - Spam email detection (spam or not spam)
    - Image classification (cat or dog)
    - Sentiment analysis (positive or negative review)

Example 2: Multiclass Classification:

- Involves classifying data points into **more than two** predefined categories.
- The number of categories can be any number greater than two.
- Examples:
    - Image classification (identifying different types of animals like cat, dog, bird)
    - Handwritten digit recognition (classifying digits 0-9)
    - Predicting customer churn (loyal customer, at-risk customer, likely to churn)

Example 3: Regression is a statistical technique used for **predicting continuous values** based on one or more independent variables (features). It aims to establish a relationship between the independent variables and a dependent variable (target) that can be used to make predictions for new unseen data points.

Here are some key aspects of regression:

- Continuous Values: Unlike classification which predicts discrete categories, regression predicts continuous values like housing prices, sales figures, or customer lifetime value.
- Relationships: Regression models learn the underlying relationship between the features and the target variable. This relationship can be linear (straight line) or non-linear (more complex curves).
- Predictions: Once trained, the regression model can be used to predict the target variable for new data points based on their feature values
