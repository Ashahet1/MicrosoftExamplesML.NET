This are the examples tried for learning machine learning from Microsoft ML.NET.

Example:

**Basic Classification (Binary Classification):**

- Deals with classifying data points into **exactly two** predefined categories.
- Often referred to as binary classification because there are only two possible outcomes.
- Examples:
    - Spam email detection (spam or not spam)
    - Image classification (cat or dog)
    - Sentiment analysis (positive or negative review)

**Multiclass Classification:**

- Involves classifying data points into **more than two** predefined categories.
- The number of categories can be any number greater than two.
- Examples:
    - Image classification (identifying different types of animals like cat, dog, bird)
    - Handwritten digit recognition (classifying digits 0-9)
    - Predicting customer churn (loyal customer, at-risk customer, likely to churn)
