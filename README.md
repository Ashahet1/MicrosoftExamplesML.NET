## ML.NET Example Projects 🚀

This README outlines the different types of machine learning tasks demonstrated by the example projects in this repository:

**Classification Tasks:**

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Predict whether a text (like a product review) expresses a positive or negative sentiment. This demonstrates a **binary classification** task. 👍👎
* **GitHub Issue Classification:** Categorize GitHub issues into different labels based on their description. This demonstrates a **multiclass classification** task. 🏷️➡️ 

**Regression Tasks:**

* **Price Predictor:** Predict a numerical value, such as the price of a product, based on its features. This demonstrates a **regression** task. 📈

**Clustering Tasks:**

* **Iris Clustering:** Group data points (in this case, Iris flower measurements) into clusters based on their similarities, without predefined labels. This demonstrates a **clustering** task. 🌸➡️ 

**Recommendation Systems:**

* **Recommendation:** Generate personalized recommendations for movies based on users' past ratings. 🎬⭐

**Deep Learning Integration:**

* **Image Classification:** Customize an existing image recognition model (TensorFlow) to classify images into new, specific categories. This demonstrates **transfer learning**. 🖼️➡️ 
* **Detect Objects in Images:** Identify and locate specific objects within images using a pre-trained ONNX model. 🎯🔍

**Working with Pre-trained Models:**

* **Classify Sentiment of Movie Reviews (TensorFlow):** Utilize a pre-trained TensorFlow model to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in movie reviews. 🎥➡️ 

**Anomaly Detection:**

* **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual or unexpected data points in product sales data. This demonstrates an **anomaly detection** task. ⚠️📊
